	<h3> Claire Dunphy </h3>
	<h4> Claire is a mother of 3 kids and a wife to Phil Dunphy for many years. She is depicted to be a perfectionist, uptight, and competitive person but she also has a brittle personality which causes her to sometimes be a toxic character. I honestly see myself in Claire, even when many fans hate her. Claire is the type of person who gets mad easily because she's eager to be right but then she also learns her lesson and realizes her mistakes at the end of every episode. </h4>

	<h3> Haley Dunphy </h3>
	<h4> Haley Dunphy is the eldest daughter of Phil and Claire Dunphy. She is portrayed to be the stereotypical teenager. Honestly, I believe that Haley may not be as intelligent in academics but Haley is very street smart and emotionally intelligent. I also see myself in her because at times, she can be an annoying and selfish older sister but at most times she really looks out for her younger siblings. </h4>

	<h3>Jay Pritchett</h3>
	<h4> Jay is the father of Claire, Mitchell, Manny and Joe. He is also the grandfather of Haley, Alex, Luke, and Lily. Basically, he is the main family root. He is a veteran and he often shows masculinity throughout the show. At the early seasons, he was having a hard time to accept the homosexuality of his second child but at the later seasons we were able to see his emotional growth, love, and acceptance for the LGBTQ+. I see my dad in Jay because despite the mindset of not showing his emotions, he is still trying his very best. One of my favorite episodes is the Lake episode where Jay rented a boat in the lake for the whole family to watch the eclipse. They didnt get to because of their own issues but they gave me a very heart warming end.
